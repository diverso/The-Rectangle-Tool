The-Rectangle-Tool
==================

I've implemented an interface in Javascript that creates rectangles and estimates their sizes and does other interesting stuff as described below. 


<ul>
<li>Allows the user to specify the number of input rectangles (between 3 and 30).
<li>Generates the requested number of input rectangles (with random widths and heights) and write them to a file (human readable).
<li>Reads the randomly generated input rectangles from the file generated in the step above.
<li>Displays the input rectangles graphically, correctly laid out, as in the example.
<li>Calculates the output rectangles.
<li>Displays the output rectangles graphically, correctly laid out as in the example above. 
<li>Writes the output rectangle coordinates into an output file (human readable).
<ul/>
